3D Scene Management for efficiently drawing a large terrain and a lot of objects. 
====================================
1. Description
-------------------
- This project implements a "Loose" Octree Scene Manager to cull away a lot of objects that are not visible to the viewer. Thus, reducing unnecessary drawing operations because in the end, they will not be seen on the screen.
- Together with the Octree Scene Manager, there is also a Quad Tree Renderer for terrain's drawing. Similarly, this Renderer will cull away unseen parts of the terrain as well as reduce the details of some parts that are far away from viewer. 

- The project is implemented using Visual C++ 2008 & OpenGL (no shader).

- The sample video is here: http://youtu.be/djqe-QKh6wQ
- The prebuilt demo application can be found in Releases section of Github page.
